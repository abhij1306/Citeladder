 * ONE definition of "what a crawl change refreshes".

 * The Site Health screen used to run five independent 4s polls over the same

 * while the SSE hook invalidated a hand-listed set of keys on every frame.
 * Overlapping refetches then resolved out of order and panels rendered state
 * from different moments — counts ticking backwards, a score appearing then
 * vanishing. Now there is a single subscription (the dashboard query's timer)
 * plus the stream, and BOTH refresh the derived views through this module, so
 * the two paths can never drift apart.
