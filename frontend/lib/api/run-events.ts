/**
 * Audit run-event SSE parsing (transport half; the React hook lives in
 * `lib/runs/use-run-events.ts`).
 *
 * The stream is an INVALIDATION ACCELERATOR, never a data source. A parsed
 * event tells the UI that something changed and which queries are now stale —
 * it never becomes an execution row. Payloads carry opaque ids, statuses and
 * retry timing only, so building a row from one would mean inventing the
 * fields it deliberately omits, and replayed or out-of-order events would then
 * corrupt the table. Refetching through the normal endpoint keeps strict
 * whole-response validation on the only path that produces rows.
 *
 * `apiClient` is JSON-only, so this module owns a direct `fetch` — with the
 * same credentials + workspace-header contract, exactly as `use-crawl-events`
 * does for Site Health.
